  abstract = {Regulatory T (Treg) cells play crucial roles in suppressing deleterious immune response. Here, we investigate how Treg cells are mechanistically induced in~vitro (iTreg) and stabilized via transcriptional regulation of Treg lineage-specifying factor Foxp3. We find that acetylation of histone tails at the Foxp3 promoter is required for inducing Foxp3 transcription. Upon induction, histone acetylation signals via bromodomain-containing proteins, particularly targets of inhibitor JQ1, and sustains Foxp3 transcription via a global or trans effect. Subsequently, Tet-mediated DNA demethylation of Foxp3 cis-regulatory elements, mainly enhancer CNS2, increases chromatin accessibility and protein binding, stabilizing Foxp3 transcription and obviating the need for the histone acetylation signal. These processes transform stochastic iTreg induction into a stable cell fate, with the former sensitive and the latter resistant to genetic and environmental perturbations. Thus, sequential histone acetylation and DNA demethylation in Foxp3 induction and maintenance reflect stepwise mechanical switches governing iTreg cell lineage specification.},

  abstract = {Since numerous RNAs and RBPs prevalently localize to active chromatin regions, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) may be potential transcriptional regulators. RBPs are generally thought to regulate transcription via noncoding RNAs. Here, we describe a distinct, dual mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the previously uncharacterized tRNA-modifying enzyme, hTrmt13. On one hand, hTrmt13 acts in the cytoplasm to catalyze 2'-O-methylation of tRNAs, thus regulating translation in a manner depending on its tRNA-modification activity. On the other hand, nucleus-localized hTrmt13 directly binds DNA as a transcriptional co-activator of key epithelial-mesenchymal transition factors, thereby promoting cell migration independent of tRNA-modification activity. These dual functions of hTrmt13 are mutually exclusive, as it can bind either DNA or tRNA through its CHHC zinc finger domain. Finally, we find that hTrmt13 expression is tightly associated with poor prognosis and survival in diverse cancer patients. Our discovery of the noncatalytic roles of an RNA-modifying enzyme provides a new perspective for understanding epitranscriptomic regulation.},

Overexpression of CDK4/6 or Rb1 knockout confers neuroblastoma cell resistance to both palbociclib and the KDM6 inhibitor GSK-J4.

  abstract = {Background The transcription factor CTCF appears indispensable in defining topologically associated domain boundaries and maintaining chromatin loop structures within these domains, supported by numerous functional studies. However, acute depletion of CTCF globally reduces chromatin interactions but does not significantly alter transcription. Results Here, we systematically integrate multi-omics data including ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, WGBS, Hi-C, Cut\&Run, and CRISPR-Cas9 survival dropout screens, and time-solved deep proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses in cells carrying auxin-induced degron at endogenous CTCF locus. Acute CTCF protein degradation markedly rewires genome-wide chromatin accessibility. Increased accessible chromatin regions are frequently located adjacent to CTCF-binding sites at promoter regions and insulator sites associated with enhanced transcription of nearby genes. In addition, we use CTCF-associated multi-omics data to establish a combinatorial data analysis pipeline to discover CTCF co-regulatory partners. We successfully identify 40 candidates, including multiple established partners. Interestingly, many CTCF co-regulators that have alterations of their respective downstream gene expression do not show changes of their own expression levels across the multi-omics measurements upon acute CTCF loss, highlighting the strength of our system to discover hidden co-regulatory partners associated with CTCF-mediated transcription. Conclusions This study highlights that CTCF loss rewires genome-wide chromatin accessibility, which plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation.},

  abstract = {Lineage ambiguous leukemias are high-risk malignancies of poorly understood genetic basis. Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of acute leukemia with expression of myeloid, T lymphoid and stem cell markers driven by aberrant allele-specific deregulation of BCL11B, a master transcription factor responsible for thymic T-lineage commitment and specification. Mechanistically, this deregulation was driven by chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose BCL11B to super-enhancers active in hematopoietic progenitors, or focal amplifications that generate a super-enhancer from a non-coding element distal to BCL11B. Chromatin conformation analyses demonstrate long range interactions of rearranged enhancers with the expressed BCL11B allele, and association of BCL11B with activated hematopoietic progenitor cell cis-regulatory elements, suggesting BCL11B is aberrantly co-opted into a gene regulatory network that drives transformation by maintaining a progenitor state. These data support a role for ectopic BCL11B expression in primitive hematopoietic cells mediated by enhancer hijacking as an oncogenic driver of human lineage ambiguous leukemia.},

  abstract = {Neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) is a defining feature of organismal aging that is influenced by peripheral tissues. Clinical observations indicate that skeletal muscle influences CNS aging, but the underlying muscle-to-brain signaling remains unexplored. In Drosophila, we find that moderate perturbation of the proteasome in skeletal muscle induces compensatory preservation of CNS proteostasis during aging. Such long-range stress signaling depends on muscle-secreted Amyrel amylase. Mimicking stress-induced Amyrel upregulation in muscle reduces age-related accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the brain and retina via chaperones. Preservation of proteostasis stems from the disaccharide maltose, which is produced via Amyrel amylase activity. Correspondingly, RNAi for SLC45 maltose transporters reduces expression of Amyrel-induced chaperones and worsens brain proteostasis during aging. Moreover, maltose preserves proteostasis and neuronal activity in human brain organoids challenged by thermal stress. Thus, proteasome stress in skeletal muscle hinders retinal and brain aging by mounting an adaptive response via amylase/maltose.},

CNS0 facilitated the IL-2 dependent CD25+Foxp3\textendash{} precursor to Treg cell transition in the thymus.

While the thymic Treg cell paucity caused by CNS0 deficiency did not result in autoimmunity on its own, it exacerbated autoimmune manifestations caused by disruption of the Aire gene.

However, how TET enzymes are recruited and regulated at these genomic loci is not fully understood. Here, we identify TET2, the glycosyltransferase OGT and a previously undescribed proline and serine rich protein, PROSER1 as interactors of UTX, a component of the enhancer-associated MLL3/4 complexes. We find that PROSER1 mediates the interaction between OGT and TET2, thus promoting TET2 O-GlcNAcylation and protein stability. In addition, PROSER1, UTX, TET1/2, and OGT colocalize on many genomic elements genome-wide. Loss of PROSER1 results in lower enrichment of UTX, TET1/2, and OGT at enhancers and CpG islands, with a concomitant increase in DNA methylation and transcriptional down-regulation of associated target genes and increased DNA hypermethylation encroachment at H3K4me1-predisposed CpG islands. Furthermore, we provide evidence that PROSER1 acts as a more general regulator of OGT activity by controlling O-GlcNAcylation of multiple other chromatin signaling pathways. Taken together, this study describes for the first time a regulator of TET2 O-GlcNAcylation and its implications in mediating DNA demethylation at UTX-dependent enhancers and CpG islands and supports an important role for PROSER1 in regulating the function of various chromatin-associated proteins via OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation.},

However, it is not known whether the source of stem cells is important for the production of differentiated cells suitable for transplantation. To test this, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from murine rod photoreceptors (r-iPSCs) and scored their ability to make retinae by using a standardized quantitative protocol called STEM-RET. We discovered that r-iPSCs more efficiently produced differentiated retinae than did embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or fibroblast-derived iPSCs (f-iPSCs). Retinae derived from f-iPSCs had fewer amacrine cells and other inner nuclear layer cells. Integrated epigenetic analysis showed that DNA methylation contributes to the defects in f-iPSC retinogenesis and that rod-specific CTCF insulator protein-binding sites may promote r-iPSC retinogenesis. Together, our data suggest that the source of stem cells is important for producing retinal neurons in three-dimensional (3D) organ cultures.},

 abstract = {Skip to Next Section Retinal development requires precise temporal and spatial coordination of cell cycle exit, cell fate specification, cell migration and differentiation. When this process is disrupted, retinoblastoma, a developmental tumor of the retina, can form. Epigenetic modulators are central to precisely coordinating developmental events, and many epigenetic processes have been implicated in cancer. Studying epigenetic mechanisms in development is challenging because they often regulate multiple cellular processes; therefore, elucidating the primary molecular mechanisms involved can be difficult. Here we explore the role of Brg1 (Smarca4) in retinal development and retinoblastoma in mice using molecular and cellular approaches. Brg1 was found to regulate retinal size by controlling cell cycle length, cell cycle exit and cell survival during development. Brg1 was not required for cell fate specification but was required for photoreceptor differentiation and cell adhesion/polarity programs that contribute to proper retinal lamination during development. The combination of defective cell differentiation and lamination led to retinal degeneration in Brg1-deficient retinae. Despite the hypocellularity, premature cell cycle exit, increased cell death and extended cell cycle length, retinal progenitor cells persisted in Brg1-deficient retinae, making them more susceptible to retinoblastoma. ChIP-Seq analysis suggests that Brg1 might regulate gene expression through multiple mechanisms.},

Here, we found that changes in glucose levels increase the activity of the glucose-responsive transcription factor MLX (Max-like protein X), which promotes and is necessary for myoblast fusion. MLX promotes myogenesis not via an adjustment of glucose metabolism but rather by inducing the expression of several myokines, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), whereas RNAi and dominant-negative MLX reduce IGF2 expression and block myogenesis. This phenotype is rescued by conditioned medium from control muscle cells and by recombinant IGF2, which activates the myogenic kinase Akt. Importantly, MLX-null mice display decreased IGF2 induction and diminished muscle regeneration in response to injury, indicating that the myogenic function of MLX is manifested in vivo. Thus, glucose is a signaling molecule that regulates myogenesis and muscle regeneration via MLX/IGF2/Akt signaling.},

 abstract = {Females and males differ in antibody isotype expression patterns and in immune responses to foreign- and self-antigens. For example, systemic lupus erythematosus is a condition that associates with the production of isotype-skewed anti-self antibodies, and exhibits a 9:1 female:male disease ratio. To explain differences between B cell responses in males and females, we sought to identify direct interactions of the estrogen receptor (ER) with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. This effort was encouraged by our previous identification of estrogen response elements (ERE) in heavy chain switch (S) regions. We conducted a full-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP-seq) using DNA from LPS-activated B cells and an ER{$\alpha$}-specific antibody. Results revealed ER binding to a wide region of DNA, spanning sequences from the JH cluster to C{$\delta$}, with peaks in E{$\mu$} and S{$\mu$} sites. Additional peaks of ER{$\alpha$} binding were coincident with hs1,2 and hs4 sites in the 3{${'}$} regulatory region (3{${'}$}RR) of the heavy chain locus. This first demonstration of direct binding of ER to key regulatory elements in the immunoglobulin locus supports our hypothesis that estrogen and other nuclear hormone receptors and ligands may directly influence antibody expression and class switch recombination (CSR). Our hypothesis encourages the conduct of new experiments to evaluate the consequences of ER binding. A better understanding of ER:DNA interactions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, and respective mechanisms, may ultimately translate to better control of antibody expression, better protection against pathogens, and prevention of pathologies caused by auto-immune disease.},

 abstract = {Chromosomal rearrangements deregulating hematopoietic transcription factors are common in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we show that deregulation of the homeobox transcription factor gene DUX4 and the ETS transcription factor gene ERG is a hallmark of a subtype of B-progenitor ALL that comprises up to 7\% of B-ALL. DUX4 rearrangement and overexpression was present in all cases and was accompanied by transcriptional deregulation of ERG, expression of a novel ERG isoform, ERGalt, and frequent ERG deletion. ERGalt uses a non-canonical first exon whose transcription was initiated by DUX4 binding. ERGalt retains the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of ERG, but it inhibits wild-type ERG transcriptional activity and is transforming. These results illustrate a unique paradigm of transcription factor deregulation in leukemia in which DUX4 deregulation results in loss of function of ERG, either by deletion or induced expression of an isoform that is a dominant-negative inhibitor of wild-type ERG function.},

 abstract = {Vitamin A deficiencies are common throughout the world and have a significant negative influence on immune protection against viral infections. Mouse models demonstrate that the production of IgA, a first line of defense against viruses at mucosal sites, is inhibited in the context of vitamin A deficiency. In vitro, the addition of vitamin A to activated B cells can enhance IgA expression, but downregulate IgE. Previous reports have demonstrated that vitamin A modifies cytokine patterns, and in so doing may influence antibody isotype expression by an indirect mechanism. However, we have now discovered hundreds of potential response elements among S{$\mu$}, S{$\varepsilon$}, and S{$\alpha$} switch sites within immunoglobulin heavy chain loci. These hotspots appear in both mouse and human loci and include targets for vitamin receptors and related proteins (e.g., estrogen receptors) in the nuclear receptor superfamily. Full response elements with direct repeats are relatively infrequent or absent in S{$\gamma$} regions although half-sites are present. Based on these results, we pose a hypothesis that nuclear receptors have a direct effect on the immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination event. We propose that vitamin A may alter S site accessibility to activation-induced deaminase and nonhomologous end-joining machinery, thereby influencing the isotype switch, antibody production, and protection against viral infections at mucosal sites.},

Here we profile the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during retinogenesis in mice and humans. Although some progenitor genes and cell cycle genes were epigenetically silenced during retinogenesis, the most dramatic change was derepression of cell-type-specific differentiation programs. We identified developmental-stage-specific super-enhancers and showed that most epigenetic changes are conserved in humans and mice. To determine how the epigenome changes during tumorigenesis and reprogramming, we performed integrated epigenetic analysis of murine and human retinoblastomas and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from murine rod photoreceptors. The retinoblastoma epigenome mapped to the developmental stage when retinal progenitors switch from neurogenic to terminal patterns of cell division. The epigenome of retinoblastomas was more similar to that of the normal retina than that of retina-derived iPSCs, and we identified retina-specific epigenetic memory.},

 abstract = {The amplified MYCN gene serves as an oncogenic driver in approximately 20\% of high-risk pediatric neuroblastomas. Here, we show that the family member MYC is a potent transforming gene in a separate subset of high-risk neuroblastoma cases ({$\sim$}10\%), based on (i) its upregulation by focal enhancer amplification or genomic rearrangements leading to enhancer hijacking, and (ii) its ability to transform neuroblastoma precursor cells in a transgenic animal model. The aberrant regulatory elements associated with oncogenic MYC activation include focally amplified distal enhancers and translocation of highly active enhancers from other genes to within topologically associating domains containing the MYC gene locus. The clinical outcome for patients with high levels of MYC expression is virtually identical to that of patients with amplification of the MYCN gene, a known high-risk feature of this disease. Together, these findings establish MYC as a bona fide oncogene in a clinically significant group of high-risk childhood neuroblastomas. Significance: Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is a recognized hallmark of high-risk pediatric neuroblastoma. Here, we demonstrate that MYC is also activated as a potent oncogene in a distinct subset of neuroblastoma cases through either focal amplification of distal enhancers or enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal translocation.

Neurons are difficult to reprogram, and there has not been a systematic side-by-side characterization of reprogramming efficiency or epigenetic memory across different neuronal subtypes. Here, we compare reprogramming efficiency of five different retinal cell types at two different stages of development. Retinal differentiation from each iPSC line was measured using a quantitative standardized scoring system called STEM-RET and compared to the epigenetic memory. Neurons with the lowest reprogramming efficiency produced iPSC lines with the best retinal differentiation and were more likely to retain epigenetic memory of their cellular origins.

Despite the critical role of this pathway in tissue growth and tumorigenesis, it remains unclear how YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription drives proliferation. By analyzing the effects of inactivating LATS1/2 kinases, the direct upstream inhibitors of YAP/TAZ, on mouse brain development and applying cell-number-normalized transcriptome analyses, we discovered that YAP/TAZ activation causes a global increase in~transcription activity, known as hypertranscription,~and upregulates many genes associated with cell growth and proliferation. In contrast, conventional~read-depth-normalized RNA-sequencing analysis failed to detect the scope of the transcriptome shift and missed most relevant gene ontologies. Following a transient increase in proliferation, however, hypertranscription in neural progenitors triggers replication stress, DNA damage, and p53 activation, resulting in massive apoptosis. Our findings reveal a significant impact of YAP/TAZ activation on global transcription activity and have important implications for understanding YAP/TAZ function.},

Here we show that the two principal subtypes of MPAL, T/myeloid (T/M) and B/myeloid (B/M), are genetically distinct. Rearrangement of ZNF384 is common in B/M MPAL, and biallelic WT1 alterations are common in T/M MPAL, which shares genomic features with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We show that the intratumoral immunophenotypic heterogeneity characteristic of MPAL is independent of somatic genetic variation, that founding lesions arise in primitive haematopoietic progenitors, and that individual phenotypic subpopulations can reconstitute the immunophenotypic diversity in vivo. These findings indicate that the cell of origin and founding lesions, rather than an accumulation of distinct genomic alterations, prime tumour cells for lineage promiscuity. Moreover, these findings position MPAL in the spectrum of immature leukaemias and provide a genetically informed framework for future clinical trials of potential treatments for MPAL.},

Mouse models that recapitulate human G3 MB all rely on retroviral vector-induced Myc expression driven by viral regulatory elements (Retro-Myc tumors). We used nuclease-deficient CRISPR/dCas9-based gene activation with combinatorial single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to enforce transcription of endogenous Myc in Trp53-null neurospheres that were orthotopically transplanted into the brains of na\"ive animals. Three combined sgRNAs linked to dCas9-VP160 induced cellular Myc expression and large cell anaplastic MBs (CRISPR-Myc tumors) which recapitulated the molecular characteristics of mouse and human G3 MBs. The BET inhibitor JQ1 suppressed MYC expression in a human G3 MB cell line (HD-MB03) and CRISPR-Myc, but not in Retro-Myc MBs. This G3 MB mouse model in which Myc expression is regulated by its own promoter will facilitate pre-clinical studies with drugs that regulate Myc transcription.},

 abstract = {Histone H3 K27M mutation is the defining molecular feature of the devastating pediatric brain tumor, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The prevalence of histone H3 K27M mutations indicates a critical role in DIPGs, but the contribution of the mutation to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. We show that knockdown of this mutation in DIPG xenografts restores K27M-dependent loss of H3K27me3 and delays tumor growth. Comparisons of matched DIPG xenografts with and without K27M knockdown allowed identification of mutation-specific effects on the transcriptome and epigenome. The resulting transcriptional changes recapitulate expression signatures from K27M primary DIPG tumors and are strongly enriched for genes associated with nervous system development. Integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and expression data showed that genes upregulated by the mutation are overrepresented in apparently bivalent promoters. Many of these targets are associated with more immature differentiation states. Expression profiles indicate K27M knockdown decreases proliferation and increases differentiation within lineages represented in DIPG. These data suggest that K27M-mediated loss of H3K27me3 directly regulates a subset of genes by releasing poised promoters, and contributes to tumor phenotype and growth by limiting differentiation. The delayed tumor growth associated with knockdown of H3 K27M provides evidence that this highly recurrent mutation is a relevant therapeutic target.},

 abstract = {Sex hormones are best known for their influences on reproduction, but they also have profound influences on the immune response. Examples of sex-specific differences include: (i) the relatively poor control of influenza virus infections in males compared to females, (ii) allergic asthma, an IgE-associated hypersensitivity reaction that is exacerbated in adolescent females compared to males, and (iii) systemic lupus erythematosus, a life-threatening autoimmune disease with a 9:1 female:male bias. Here we consider how estrogen and estrogen receptor {$\alpha$} (ER{$\alpha$}) may influence the immune response by modifying class switch recombination (CSR) and immunoglobulin expression patterns. We focus on ER{$\alpha$} binding to enhancers (E{$\mu$} and the 3{${'}$} regulatory region) and switch sites (S\textmu{} and S{$\epsilon$}) in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Our preliminary data from ChIP-seq analyses of purified, activated B cells show estrogen-mediated changes in the positioning of ER{$\alpha$} binding within and near S\textmu{} and S{$\epsilon$}. In the presence of estrogen, ER{$\alpha$} is bound not only to estrogen response elements (ERE), but also to adenosine-cytidine (AC)-repeats and poly adenosine (poly A) sequences, in some cases within constant region gene introns. We propose that by binding these sites, estrogen and ER{$\alpha$} directly participate in the DNA loop formation required for CSR. We further suggest that estrogen regulates immunoglobulin expression patterns and can thereby influence life-and-death outcomes of infection, hypersensitivity, and autoimmune disease.},

 abstract = {Nuclear hormone receptors including the estrogen receptor (ER{$\alpha$}) and the retinoic acid receptor regulate a plethora of biological functions including reproduction, circulation and immunity. To understand how estrogen and other nuclear hormones influence antibody production, we characterized total serum antibody isotypes in female and male mice of C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ and C3H/HeJ mouse strains. Antibody levels were higher in females compared to males in all strains and there was a female preference for IgG2b production. Sex-biased patterns were influenced by vitamin levels, and by antigen specificity toward influenza virus or pneumococcus antigens. To help explain sex biases, we examined the direct effects of estrogen on immunoglobulin heavy chain sterile transcript production among purified, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells. Supplemental estrogen in B-cell cultures significantly increased immunoglobulin heavy chain sterile transcripts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of activated B cells identified significant ER{$\alpha$} binding to estrogen response elements (EREs) centered within enhancer elements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, including the E\textmu{} enhancer and hypersensitive site 1,2 (HS1,2) in the 3{${'}$} regulatory region. The ERE in HS1,2 was conserved across animal species, and in humans marked a site of polymorphism associated with the estrogen-augmented autoimmune disease, lupus. Taken together, the results highlight: (i) the important targets of ER{$\alpha$} in regulatory regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus that influence antibody production, and (ii) the complexity of mechanisms by which estrogen instructs sex-biased antibody production profiles.},

 abstract = {A defining feature of adaptive immunity is the development of long-lived memory T cells to curtail infection. Recent studies have identified a unique stem-like T-cell subset amongst exhausted CD8-positive T cells in chronic infection1\textendash 3, but it remains unclear whether CD4-positive T-cell subsets with similar features exist in chronic inflammatory conditions. Amongst helper T cells, TH17 cells have prominent roles in autoimmunity and tissue inflammation and are characterized by inherent plasticity4\textendash 7, although how such plasticity is regulated is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that TH17 cells in a mouse model of autoimmune disease are functionally and metabolically heterogeneous; they contain a subset with stemness-associated features but lower anabolic metabolism, and a reciprocal subset with higher metabolic activity that supports transdifferentiation into TH1-like cells. These two TH17-cell subsets are defined by selective expression of the transcription factors TCF-1 and T-bet, and by discrete levels of CD27 expression. We also identify signalling via the kinase complex mTORC1 as a central regulator of TH17-cell fate decisions by coordinating metabolic and transcriptional programmes. TH17 cells with disrupted mTORC1 signalling or anabolic metabolism fail to induce autoimmune neuroinflammation or to develop into TH1-like cells, but instead upregulate TCF-1 expression and acquire stemness-associated features. Single-cell RNA sequencing and experimental validation reveal heterogeneity in fate-mapped TH17 cells, and a developmental arrest in the TH1 transdifferentiation trajectory upon loss of mTORC1 activity or metabolic perturbation. Our results establish that the dichotomy of stemness and effector function underlies the heterogeneous TH17 responses and autoimmune pathogenesis, and point to previously unappreciated metabolic control of plasticity in helper T cells.},

 abstract = {Numerous pieces of evidence support the complex, 3D spatial organization of the genome dictates gene expression. CTCF is essential to define topologically associated domain boundaries and to facilitate the formation of insulated chromatin loop structures. To understand CTCF's direct role in global transcriptional regulation, we integrated the miniAID-mClover3 cassette to the endogenous CTCF locus in a human pediatric B-ALL cell line, SEM, and an immortal erythroid precursor cell line, HUDEP-2, to allow for acute depletion of CTCF protein by the auxin-inducible degron system. In SEM cells, CTCF loss notably disrupted intra-TAD loops and TAD integrity in concurrence with a reduction in CTCF-binding affinity, while showing no perturbation to nuclear compartment integrity. Strikingly, the overall effect of CTCF's loss on transcription was minimal. Whole transcriptome analysis showed hundreds of genes differentially expressed in CTCF-depleted cells, among which MYC and a number of MYC target genes were specifically downregulated. Mechanically, acute depletion of CTCF disrupted the direct interaction between the MYC promoter and its distal enhancer cluster residing {$\sim$}1.8 Mb downstream. Notably, MYC expression was not profoundly affected upon CTCF loss in HUDEP-2 cells suggesting that CTCF could play a B-ALL cell line specific role in maintaining MYC expression.},

 abstract = {The histone mark H3K27me3 and its reader/writer Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mediate widespread transcriptional repression in stem and progenitor cells. Mechanisms that regulate this activity are critical for hematopoietic development but poorly understood. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO11 relieves PRC2-mediated repression during erythroid maturation by targeting its newly identified substrate BAHD1, an H3K27me3 reader that recruits transcriptional co-repressors. Erythroblasts lacking FBXO11 are developmentally delayed, with reduced expression of maturation-associated genes, most of which harbor bivalent histone marks (activating H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3), bind BAHD1, and fail to recruit the erythroid transcription factor GATA1. The BAHD1 complex interacts physically with PRC2 and depletion of either component restores FBXO11-deficient erythroid gene expression. Our studies identify BAHD1 as a novel effector of PRC2-mediated repression and reveal how a single E3 ubiquitin ligase eliminates PRC2 repression at developmentally poised bivalent genes during erythropoiesis.},

 abstract = {Mutations in Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling promote aberrant proliferation and tumor growth. SHH medulloblastoma (MB) is among the most frequent brain tumors in children less than three years of age. While key components of the SHH pathway are well-known, we hypothesized that new disease-modifying targets of SHH MB might be identified from large-scale bioinformatics and systems biology analyses. Using a data-driven systems biology approach, we built a medulloblastoma-specific interactome. The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCC4 was identified as a modulator of SHH-MB. Accordingly, increased ABCC4 expression correlated with poor overall survival in SHH MB patients. Knockdown of ABCC4 expression markedly blunted the constitutive activation of the SHH pathway secondary to Ptch1 or Sufu insufficiency. In human tumor cell lines, ABCC4 knockdown and inhibition reduced full-length GLI3 levels. In a clinically relevant murine SHH MB model, targeted ablation of Abcc4 in primary tumors significantly reduced tumor burden and extended the lifespan of tumor-bearing mice. These studies reveal ABCC4 as a potent SHH pathway regulator and a new candidate to target with the potential to improve SHH MB therapy.},

HOXA9 overexpression not only predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of HOXA9 regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we generated the HOXA9-mCherry knock-in reporter cell lines to dissect HOXA9 regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified transcription factors controlling HOXA9 expression, including a novel regulator, USF2, whose depletion significantly down-regulated HOXA9 expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 rescued impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut and Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 at HOXA9 promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the HOXA9 reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the HOXA9 regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation network in HOXA9-driven leukemia.},

 abstract = {In animals, the brain regulates feeding behavior in response to local energy demands of peripheral tissues, which secrete orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones. Although skeletal muscle is a key peripheral tissue, it remains unknown whether muscle-secreted hormones regulate feeding. In Drosophila, we found that decapentaplegic (dpp), the homolog of human bone morphogenetic proteins BMP2 and BMP4, is a muscle-secreted factor (a myokine) that is induced by nutrient sensing and that circulates and signals to the brain. Muscle-restricted dpp RNAi promotes foraging and feeding initiation, whereas dpp overexpression reduces it. This regulation of feeding by muscle-derived Dpp stems from modulation of brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and dopamine biosynthesis. Consistently, Dpp receptor signaling in dopaminergic neurons regulates TH expression and feeding initiation via the downstream transcriptional repressor Schnurri. Moreover, pharmacologic modulation of TH activity rescues the changes in feeding initiation due to modulation of dpp expression in muscle. These findings indicate that muscle-to-brain endocrine signaling mediated by the myokine Dpp regulates feeding behavior.},

In the mouse embryo in vivo, Ybx1 is required for forebrain specification and restricting mid-hindbrain growth. In neural progenitor cells (NPCs), Ybx1 controls self-renewal and neuronal differentiation.

These functions are consistent with Ybx1-mediated promotion of genes involved in forebrain specification, cell proliferation, or neuronal differentiation. In Ybx1-knockout NPCs, H3K27me3 reduction by PRC2 enzymatic inhibitor or genetic depletion partially rescues gene expression and NPC functions.

 abstract = {Aggressive cancers often have activating mutations in growth-controlling oncogenes and inactivating mutations in tumor-suppressor genes. In neuroblastoma, amplification of the MYCN oncogene and inactivation of the ATRX tumor-suppressor gene correlate with high-risk disease and poor prognosis. Here we show that ATRX mutations and MYCN amplification are mutually exclusive across all ages and stages in neuroblastoma. Using human cell lines and mouse models, we found that elevated MYCN expression and ATRX mutations are incompatible. Elevated MYCN levels promote metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive-oxygen species generation, and DNA-replicative stress. The combination of replicative stress caused by defects in the ATRX\textendash histone chaperone complex, and that induced by MYCN-mediated metabolic reprogramming, leads to synthetic lethality. Therefore, ATRX and MYCN represent an unusual example, where inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene and activation of an oncogene are incompatible. This synthetic lethality may eventually be exploited to improve outcomes for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.},

 abstract = {Males and females respond to pathogens differently and exhibit significantly different frequencies of autoimmune disease. For example, vaccinated adult females control influenza virus better than males, but females suffer systemic lupus erythematosus at a 9:1 frequency compared to males. Numerous explanations have been offered for these sex differences, but most have involved indirect mechanisms by which estrogen, a nuclear hormone, modifies cell barriers or immunity. In search of a direct mechanism, we examined the binding of estrogen receptor {$\alpha$} (ER{$\alpha$}), a class I nuclear hormone receptor, to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Here, we show that in purified murine B cells, ER{$\alpha$} and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) exhibit extraordinarily similar DNA binding patterns. We further demonstrate that ER{$\alpha$} preferentially binds adenosine\textendash cytidine (AC)-repeats in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus when supplemental estrogen is added to purified, lipopolysaccharide-activated B cells. Based on these and previous data, we hypothesize that (i) estrogen guides the binding of ER{$\alpha$} and its RNA Pol II partner within the locus, which in turn instructs sterile transcription and class switch recombination (CSR), (ii) ER{$\alpha$} binding to AC-repeats modifies the DNA architecture and loops associated with CSR, and (iii) by these mechanisms, estrogen instructs antibody expression. By targeting ER{$\alpha$}-DNA interactions in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, clinicians may ultimately enhance antibody responses in the context of infectious diseases and reduce antibody responses in the context of allergic or autoimmune reactions.},

 abstract = {ZNF384-rearranged fusion oncoproteins (FO) define a subset of lineage ambiguous leukemias, but their mechanistic role in leukemogenesis and lineage ambiguity is poorly understood. Using viral expression in mouse and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and a Ep300::Znf384 knockin mouse model, we show that ZNF384 FO promote hematopoietic expansion, myeloid lineage skewing, and self-renewal. In mouse HSPCs, concomitant lesions, such as NRASG12D, were required for fully penetrant leukemia, whereas in human HSPCs, expression of ZNF384 FO drove B/myeloid leukemia, with sensitivity of a ZNF384-rearranged xenograft to FLT3 inhibition in vivo. Mechanistically, ZNF384 FO occupy a subset of predominantly intragenic/enhancer regions with increased histone 3 lysine acetylation and deregulate expression of hematopoietic stem cell transcription factors. These data define a paradigm for FO-driven lineage ambiguous leukemia, in which expression in HSPCs results in deregulation of lineage-specific genes and hematopoietic skewing, progressing to full leukemia in the context of proliferative stress.Expression of ZNF384 FO early in hematopoiesis results in binding and deregulation of key hematopoietic regulators, skewing of hematopoiesis, and priming for leukemic transformation. These results reveal the interplay between cell of origin and expression of ZNF384 FO to mediate lineage ambiguity and leukemia development.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 171},

Genome-wide association studies have identified non-coding ALL risk variants at the ARID5B gene locus, but their exact functional effects and the molecular mechanism linking ARID5B to B-cell ALL leukemogenesis remain largely unknown.We performed targeted sequencing of ARID5B in germline DNA of 5008 children with ALL. Variants were evaluated for association with ALL susceptibility using 3644 patients from the UK10K cohort as non-ALL controls, under an additive model. Cis-regulatory elements in ARID5B were systematically identified using dCas9-KRAB\textendash mediated enhancer interference system enhancer screen in ALL cells. Disruption of transcription factor binding by ARID5B variant was predicted informatically and then confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation. ARID5B variant association with hematological traits was examined using UK Biobank dataset. All statistical tests were 2-sided.We identified 54 common variants in ARID5B statistically significantly associated with leukemia risk, all of which were noncoding. Six cis-regulatory elements at the ARID5B locus were discovered using CRISPR-based high-throughput enhancer screening. Strikingly, the top ALL risk variant (rs7090445, P\,=\,5.57\,\texttimes\,10\textendash 45) is located precisely within the strongest enhancer element, which is also distally tethered to the ARID5B promoter. The variant allele disrupts the MEF2C binding motif sequence, resulting in reduced MEF2C affinity and decreased local chromosome accessibility.

 abstract = {Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a rare, high-grade, primitive mesenchymal tumor. It accounts for around 2-10\% of all chondrosarcomas and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. We previously described the HEY1-NCOA2 as a recurrent gene fusion in mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, an important breakthrough for characterizing this disease; however, little study had been done to characterize the fusion protein functionally, in large part due to a lack of suitable models for evaluating the impact of HEY1-NCOA2 expression in the appropriate cellular context. We used iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPSC-MSCs), which can differentiate into chondrocytes, and generated stable transduced iPSC-MSCs with inducible expression of HEY1-NCOA2 fusion protein, wildtype HEY1 or wildtype NCOA2. We next comprehensively analyzed both the DNA binding properties and transcriptional impact of HEY1-NCOA2 expression by integrating genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and expression profiling (RNA-seq). We demonstrated that HEY1-NCOA2 fusion protein preferentially binds to promoter regions of canonical HEY1 targets, resulting in transactivation of HEY1 targets, and significantly enhances cell proliferation. Intriguingly, we identified that both PDGFB and PDGFRA were directly targeted and upregulated by HEY1-NCOA2; and the fusion protein, but not wildtype HEY1 or NCOA2, dramatically increased the level of phospho-AKT (Ser473). Our findings provide a rationale for exploring PDGF/PI3K/AKT inhibition in treating mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. \textcopyright{} 2022 The Authors.

 abstract = {Disruption of antagonism between SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and polycomb repressor complexes drives the formation of numerous cancer types. Recently, an inhibitor of the polycomb protein EZH2 was approved for the treatment of a sarcoma mutant in the SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1, but resistance occurs. Here, we performed CRISPR screens in SMARCB1-mutant rhabdoid tumor cells to identify genetic contributors to SWI/SNF-polycomb antagonism and potential resistance mechanisms. We found that loss of the H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1 caused resistance to EZH2 inhibition. We show that NSD1 antagonizes polycomb via cooperation with SWI/SNF and identify co-occurrence of NSD1 inactivation in SWI/SNF-defective cancers, indicating in~vivo relevance. We demonstrate that H3K36me2 itself has an essential role in the activation of polycomb target genes as inhibition of the H3K36me2 demethylase KDM2A restores the efficacy of EZH2 inhibition in SWI/SNF-deficient cells lacking NSD1. Together our data expand the mechanistic understanding of SWI/SNF and polycomb interplay and identify NSD1 as the key for coordinating this transcriptional control.},

 abstract = {Decline in skeletal muscle cell size (myofiber atrophy) is a key feature of cancer-induced wasting (cachexia). In particular, atrophy of the diaphragm, the major muscle responsible for breathing, is an important determinant of cancer-associated mortality. However, therapeutic options are limited. Here, we have used Drosophila transgenic screening to identify muscle-secreted factors (myokines) that act as paracrine regulators of myofiber growth. Subsequent testing in mouse myotubes revealed that mouse Fibcd1 is an evolutionary-conserved myokine that preserves myofiber size via ERK signaling. Local administration of recombinant Fibcd1 (rFibcd1) ameliorates cachexia-induced myofiber atrophy in the diaphragm of mice bearing patient-derived melanoma xenografts and LLC carcinomas. Moreover, rFibcd1 impedes cachexia-associated transcriptional changes in the diaphragm. Fibcd1-induced signaling appears to be muscle selective because rFibcd1 increases ERK activity in myotubes but not in several cancer cell lines tested. We propose that rFibcd1 may help reinstate myofiber size in the diaphragm of patients with cancer cachexia.},

Profiling global gene expression in large ALL cohorts, we identify over-expression of FLT3 in ZNF384-rearranged ALL, consistently across cases harboring different fusion partners with ZNF384. Mechanistically, we discover an intergenic enhancer element at the FLT3 locus that is exclusively activated in ZNF384-rearranged ALL, with the enhancer-promoter looping directly mediated by the fusion protein. There is also a global enrichment of active enhancers within ZNF384 binding sites across the genome in ZNF384-rearranged ALL cells. Downregulation of ZNF384 blunts FLT3 activation and decreases ALL cell sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib in vitro. In patient-derived xenograft models of ZNF384-rearranged ALL, gilteritinib exhibits significant anti-leukemia efficacy as a monotherapy in vivo.

 abstract = {Protein quality control is important for healthy aging and is dysregulated in age-related diseases. The autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome are key for proteostasis, but it remains largely unknown whether other proteolytic systems also contribute to maintain proteostasis during aging. Here, we find that expression of proteolytic enzymes (proteases/peptidases) distinct from the autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome systems declines during skeletal muscle aging in Drosophila. Age-dependent protease downregulation undermines proteostasis, as demonstrated by the increase in detergent-insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins and pathogenic huntingtin-polyQ levels in response to protease knockdown. Computational analyses identify the transcription factor Ptx1 (homologous to human PITX1/2/3) as a regulator of protease expression. Consistent with this model, Ptx1 protein levels increase with aging, and Ptx1 RNAi counteracts the age-associated downregulation of protease expression. Moreover, Ptx1 RNAi improves muscle protein quality control in a protease-dependent manner and extends lifespan. These findings indicate that proteases and their transcriptional modulator Ptx1 ensure proteostasis during aging.},

How cancer cells acquire the ability to appropriately respond to microenvironmental stimuli remains largely unexplored. Here, we report an epigenetic pliancy mechanism that allows cancer cells to successfully metastasize. We find that a decline in the activity of the transcriptional repressor ZBTB18 defines metastasis-competent cancer cells in mouse models. Restoration of ZBTB18 activity reduces chromatin accessibility at the promoters of genes that drive metastasis, such as Tgfbr2, and this prevents TGF{$\beta$}1 pathway activation and consequently reduces cell migration and invasion. Besides repressing the expression of metastatic genes, ZBTB18 also induces widespread chromatin closing, a global epigenetic adaptation previously linked to reduced phenotypic flexibility. Thus, ZBTB18 is a potent chromatin regulator, and the loss of its activity enhances chromatin accessibility and transcriptional adaptations that promote the phenotypic changes required for metastasis.},

 abstract = {UBTF tandem duplications (UBTF-TDs) have recently emerged as a recurrent alteration in pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). UBTF-TD leukemias are characterized by a poor response to conventional chemotherapy and a transcriptional signature that mirrors NUP98-rearranged and NPM1-mutant AMLs, including HOX gene dysregulation. However, the mechanism of how UBTF-TD drives leukemogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the genomic occupancy of UBTF-TD in transformed cord-blood CD34+ (cbCD34+) cells and patient-derived xenograft models. We found that UBTF-TD protein maintained genomic occupancy at ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci while also occupying genomic targets commonly dysregulated in UBTF-TD myeloid malignancies, such as the HOXA/HOXB gene clusters and MEIS1. These data suggest that UBTF-TD is a gain-of-function alteration that results in mislocalization to genomic loci dysregulated in UBTF-TD leukemias. UBTF-TD also co-occupies key genomic loci with KMT2A and Menin, which are known to be key partners involved in HOX-dysregulated leukemias. Using a protein degradation system, we showed that stemness, proliferation, and transcriptional signatures are dependent on sustained UBTF-TD localization to chromatin. Finally, we demonstrate that primary cells from UBTF-TD leukemias are sensitive to the Menin inhibitor SNDX-5613, resulting in markedly reduced in vitro and in vivo tumor growth, myeloid differentiation, and abrogation of the UBTF-TD leukemic expression signature. These findings provide a viable therapeutic strategy for patients with this high-risk AML subtype.},

Genetic ablation of PP2Ac in glioma cells enhanced double stranded DNA (dsDNA) production and cGAS-type I interferon (IFN) signaling, MHC-I expression, and tumor mutational burden. In co-culture experiments, PP2Ac deficiency in glioma cells promoted dendritic cell (DC) cross presentation and clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells. In vivo, PP2Ac depletion sensitized tumors to immune checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy treatment. Single cell analysis demonstrated that PP2Ac deficiency increased CD8+ T cell, NK cell, and DC accumulation and reduced immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages. Furthermore, loss of PP2Ac increased IFN signaling in myeloid and tumor cells and reduced expression of a tumor gene signature associated with worse patient survival in TCGA.

Mice with macrophage PP2A deficiency exhibited reduced tumor progression. The tumor microenvironment showed decreased immunosuppressive and increased IFN-activated macrophages and CD8+ T cells.

STING agonists induced dissociation of PP2A from MST1/2 in normal macrophages, but not in tumor conditioned macrophages. Furthermore, our data showed that STRN4 mediated PP2A binding to and dephosphorylation of Hippo kinase MST1/2, resulting in stabilization of YAP/TAZ to antagonize STING activation. In human patients with glioblastoma (GBM), YAP/TAZ was highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages but not in nontumor macrophages. We also demonstrated that PP2A/STRN4 deficiency in macrophages reduced YAP/TAZ expression and sensitized tumor-conditioned macrophages to STING stimulation. In summary, we demonstrated that PP2A/STRN4-YAP/TAZ has, in our opinion, been an unappreciated mechanism that mediates immunosuppression in tumor-associated macrophages, and targeting the PP2A/STRN4-YAP/TAZ axis can sensitize tumors to immunotherapy.},

A cohort of relapsed/refractory KMT2Ar patients treated with this approach on a compassionate basis had an overall response rate of 90\%. In conclusion, we report on a high throughput drug screen in primary pediatric leukemia specimens whose results translate into clinically meaningful responses. This innovative treatment approach is now being evaluated in a multi-institutional upfront trial for infants with newly diagnosed ALL.},

Cell death is pervasive during development, but its programming is little known. Here, we report that Smad nuclear interacting protein 1 (SNIP1) promotes neural progenitor cell survival and neurogenesis and is, therefore, integral to brain development. The SNIP1-depleted brain exhibits dysplasia with robust induction of caspase 9-dependent apoptosis. Mechanistically, SNIP1 regulates target genes that promote cell survival and neurogenesis, and its activities are influenced by TGF{$\beta$} and NF{$\kappa$}B signaling pathways. Further, SNIP1 facilitates the genomic occupancy of Polycomb complex PRC2 and instructs H3K27me3 turnover at target genes. Depletion of PRC2 is sufficient to reduce apoptosis and brain dysplasia and to partially restore genetic programs in the SNIP1-depleted brain in vivo. These findings suggest a loci-specific regulation of PRC2 and H3K27 marks to toggle cell survival and death in the developing brain.},

We show that P3F expression in aP2-Cre expressing cells reprograms endothelial progenitors to functional myogenic stem cells capable of regenerating injured muscle fibers. Further, we describe a FP-RMS mouse model driven by P3F expression and Cdkn2a loss in endothelial cells. Additionally, we show that P3F expression in TP53-null human iPSCs blocks endothelial-directed differentiation and guides cells to become myogenic cells that form FP-RMS tumors in immunocompromised mice. Together these findings demonstrate that FP-RMS can originate from aberrant development of non-myogenic cells driven by P3F.},

Myofibroblasts (MFs) are present both within the tumor mass (intratumoral MFs, iMFs) and at the tumor border (peritumoral MFs, pMFs). Using a spheroid-based coculture system, we show that the initial iCCA-pMF contact is growth suppressive to the tumor cells. However, prolonged iCCA-pMF interaction elicits significant tumor cell invasion and dissemination. We find that vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (Vcam1) level is elevated in tumor cells in contact with pMFs but low in disseminated tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. A gene regulatory network analysis of mouse and patient iCCA tumors and Vcam1 knockout (Vcam1KO) demonstrate a heavy involvement of Vcam1 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. While Vcam1KO has only a limited impact on tumor cell growth in their monoculture, Vcam1KO spheroids exhibit instant dissemination and a severe growth defect when cocultured with pMFs. When transplanted into the liver, Vcam1KO iCCA cells show a similar increase in dissemination but a significant defect in establishing primary and metastatic tumors. Incomplete blocking of Vcam1 in vivo reduces the size but increase the number of metastatic lesions. Overall, our study shows a spatiotemporal regulation of iCCA growth and dissemination by pMFs in a Vcam1-dependent manner.},

However, the mechanisms controlling BETi response and resistance are not well understood. We conducted genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR screens using BETi-treated KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) cell lines. We revealed that Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) gene (Speckle Type BTB/POZ Protein) deficiency caused significant BETi resistance, which was further validated in cell lines and xenograft models. Proteomics analysis and a kinase-vulnerability CRISPR screen indicated that cells treated with BETi are sensitive to GSK3 perturbation. Pharmaceutical inhibition of GSK3 reversed the BETi-resistance phenotype. Based on this observation, a combination therapy regimen inhibiting both BET and GSK3 was developed to impede KMT2A-r leukemia progression in patient-derived xenografts in~vivo. Our results revealed molecular mechanisms underlying BETi resistance and a promising combination treatment regimen of ABBV-744 and CHIR-98014 by utilizing unique ex~vivo and in~vivo KMT2A-r PDX models.},

To help explain these differences, we first studied serum immunoglobulin isotype patterns in C57BL/6 male and female mice. We focused on IgG2b, an isotype that lends to virus control and that has been previously shown to be elevated in murine females compared to males. Improvements in IgG2b serum levels, and/or IgG2b ratios with other non-IgM isotypes, were observed when: (i) wildtype (WT) female mice were compared to estrogen receptor knockout mice (IgG2b, IgG2b/IgG3, IgG2b/IgG1, and IgG2b/IgA were all higher in WT mice), (ii) unmanipulated female mice were compared to ovariectomized mice (IgG2b/IgA was higher in unmanipulated animals), (iii) female mice were supplemented with estrogen in the context of an inflammatory insult (IgG2b and IgG2b/IgG3 were improved by estrogen supplementation), and (iv) male mice were supplemented with testosterone, a hormone that can convert to estrogen in vivo (IgG2b, IgG2b/IgG3, IgG2b/IgG1, and IgG2b/IgA were all improved by supplementation). We next examined data from three sets of previously described male and female human blood samples. In each case, there were higher IgG2 levels, and/or ratios of IgG2 with non-IgM isotypes, in human females compared to males. The effects of sex and sex hormones in the mouse and human studies were subtle, but frequent, suggesting that sex hormones represent only a fraction of the factors that influence isotype patterns. Examination of the gene loci suggested that upregulation of murine IgG2b or human IgG2 could be mediated by estrogen receptor binding to estrogen response elements and cytosine-adenine (CA) repeats upstream of respective C{$\gamma$} genes. Given that murine IgG2b and human IgG2 lend to virus control, the isotype biases in females may be sufficient to improve outcomes following vaccination or infection. Future attention to sex hormone levels, and consequent immunoglobulin isotype patterns, in clinical trials are encouraged to support the optimization of vaccine and drug products for male and female hosts.},

  abstract = {The role of ABCC4, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, in the process of platelet formation, megakaryopoiesis, is unknown. Here, we show that ABCC4 is highly expressed in megakaryocytes (MKs). Mining of public genomic data (ATAC-seq and genome wide chromatin interactions, Hi-C) revealed that key megakaryopoiesis transcription factors (TFs) interacted with ABCC4 regulatory elements and likely accounted for high ABCC4 expression in MKs. Importantly these genomic interactions for ABCC4 ranked higher than for genes with known roles in megakaryopoiesis suggesting a role for ABCC4 in megakaryopoiesis. We then demonstrate that ABCC4 is required for optimal platelet formation as in vitro differentiation of fetal liver derived MKs from Abcc4-/- mice exhibited impaired proplatelet formation and polyploidization, features required for optimal megakaryopoiesis. Likewise, a human megakaryoblastic cell line, MEG-01 showed that acute ABCC4 inhibition markedly suppressed key processes in megakaryopoiesis and that these effects were related to reduced cAMP export and enhanced dissociation of a negative regulator of megakaryopoiesis, protein kinase A (PKA) from ABCC4. PKA activity concomitantly increased after ABCC4 inhibition which was coupled with significantly reduced GATA-1 expression, a TF needed for optimal megakaryopoiesis. Further, ABCC4 protected MKs from 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) as Abcc4-/- mice show a profound reduction in MKs after 6-MP treatment. In total, our studies show that ABCC4 not only protects the MKs but is also required for maximal platelet production from MKs, suggesting modulation of ABCC4 function might be a potential therapeutic strategy to regulate platelet production.},

Here, we show deposition of one RNA modification-N2-methylguanosine (m2G) on the G72 of U6 snRNA (the catalytic center of the spliceosome) promotes efficient pre-mRNA splicing activity in human cells. This modification was identified to be conserved among vertebrates. Further, THUMPD2 was demonstrated as the methyltransferase responsible for U6 m2G72 by explicitly recognizing the U6-specific sequences and structural elements. The knock-out of THUMPD2 eliminated U6 m2G72 and impaired the pre-mRNA splicing activity, resulting in thousands of changed alternative splicing events of endogenous pre-mRNAs in human cells. Notably, the aberrantly spliced pre-mRNA population elicited the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. We further show that THUMPD2 was associated with age-related macular degeneration and retinal function. Our study thus demonstrates how an RNA epigenetic modification of the major spliceosome regulates global pre-mRNA splicing and impacts physiology and disease.},

 abstract = {Acquiring a telomere maintenance mechanism is a hallmark of high-risk neuroblastoma and commonly occurs by expressing telomerase (TERT). Telomerase-negative neuroblastoma has long telomeres and utilizes the telomerase-independent alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. Conversely, no discernable telomere maintenance mechanism is detected in a fraction of neuroblastoma with long telomeres. Here, we show, unlike most cancers, DNA of the TERT promoter is broadly hypomethylated in neuroblastoma. In telomerase-positive neuroblastoma cells, the hypomethylated DNA promoter is approximately 1.5 kb. The TERT locus shows active chromatin marks with low enrichment for the repressive mark, H3K27me3. MYCN, a commonly amplified oncogene in neuroblstoma, binds to the promoter and induces TERT expression. Strikingly, in neuroblastoma with long telomeres, the hypomethylated region spans the entire TERT locus, including multiple nearby genes with enrichment for the repressive H3K27me3 chromatin mark. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions showed enrichment of repressive chromatin marks in neuroblastomas with long telomeres relative to those with short telomeres. These repressive marks were even more evident at the genic loci, suggesting a telomere position effect (TPE). Inhibiting H3K27 methylation by three different EZH2 inhibitors induced the expression of TERT in cell lines with long telomeres and H3K27me3 marks in the promoter region. EZH2 inhibition facilitated MYCN binding to the TERT promoter in neuroblastoma cells with long telomeres. Taken together, these data suggest that epigenetic regulation of TERT expression differs in neuroblastoma depending on the telomere maintenance status, and H3K27 methylation is important in repressing TERT expression in neuroblastoma with long telomeres.The epigenetic landscape of the TERT locus is unique in neuroblastoma. The DNA at the TERT locus, unlike other cancer cells and similar to normal cells, are hypomethylated in telomerase-positive neuroblastoma cells. The TERT locus is repressed by polycomb repressive complex-2 complex in neuroblastoma cells that have long telomeres and do not express TERT. Long telomeres in neuroblastoma cells are also associated with repressive chromatin states at the chromosomal termini, suggesting TPE.},

Neuroblastoma displays cellular heterogeneity, including more differentiated (adrenergic) and more primitive (mesenchymal) cellular states. Here, we demonstrate that MYCN oncoprotein promotes a cellular state switch in mesenchymal cells to an adrenergic state, accompanied by induction of histone lysine demethylase 4 family members (KDM4A-C) that act in concert to control the expression of MYCN and adrenergic core regulatory circulatory (CRC) transcription factors. Pharmacologic inhibition of KDM4 blocks expression of MYCN and the adrenergic CRC transcriptome with genome-wide induction of transcriptionally repressive H3K9me3, resulting in potent anticancer activity against neuroblastomas with MNA by inducing neuroblastic differentiation and apoptosis. Furthermore, a short-term KDM4 inhibition in combination with conventional, cytotoxic chemotherapy results in complete tumor responses of xenografts with MNA. Thus, KDM4 blockade may serve as a transformative strategy to target the adrenergic CRC dependencies in MNA neuroblastomas.},

Here, we show that the human VSX2 SE modules have similar developmental stage- and cell type-specific activity in reporter gene assays. By inserting the human sequence of one VSX2 SE module into a mouse with microphthalmia, eye size was rescued. To understand the function of these SE modules during human retinal development, we deleted individual modules in human embryonic stem cells and generated retinal organoids. Deleting one module results in small organoids, recapitulating the small-eyed phenotype of mice with microphthalmia, while deletion of the other module led to disruptions in bipolar neuron development. This prototypical SE serves as a model for understanding developmental stage- and cell type-specific effects of neurogenic transcription factors with complex expression patterns. Moreover, by elucidating the gene regulatory mechanisms, we can begin to examine how dysregulation of these mechanisms contributes to phenotypic diversity and disease.},

 abstract = {Nuclear factor Foxp3 determines regulatory T (Treg) cell fate and function via mechanisms that remain unclear. Here, we investigate the nature of Foxp3-mediated gene regulation in suppressing autoimmunity and antitumor immune response. Contrasting with previous models, we find that Foxp3--chromatin binding is regulated by Treg activation states, tumor microenvironment, and antigen and cytokine stimulations. Proteomics studies uncover dynamic proteins within Foxp3 proximity upon TCR or IL-2 receptor signaling in vitro, reflecting intricate interactions among Foxp3, signal transducers, and chromatin. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown experiments indicate that NFAT and AP-1 protein Batf are required for enhanced Foxp3--chromatin binding in activated Treg cells and tumor-infiltrating Treg cells to modulate target gene expression. Furthermore, mutations at the Foxp3 DNA-binding domain destabilize the Foxp3--chromatin association. These representative settings delineate context-dependent Foxp3--chromatin interaction, suggesting that Foxp3 associates with chromatin by hijacking DNA-binding proteins resulting from Treg activation or differentiation, which is stabilized by direct Foxp3--DNA binding, to dynamically regulate Treg cell function according to immunological contexts.},

 abstract = {MGA (Max-gene associated) is a dual-specificity transcription factor that negatively regulates MYC-target genes to inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation. Loss-of-function mutations in MGA have been commonly identified in several hematological neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with RUNX1::RUNX1T1, however, very little is known about the impact of these MGA alterations on normal hematopoiesis or disease progression. We show that representative MGA mutations identified in patient samples abolish protein-protein interactions and transcriptional activity. Using a series of human and mouse model systems, including a newly developed conditional knock-out mouse strain, we demonstrate that loss of MGA results in upregulation of MYC and E2F targets, cell cycle genes, mTOR signaling, and oxidative phosphorylation in normal hematopoietic cells, leading to enhanced proliferation. The loss of MGA induces an open chromatin state at promoters of genes involved in cell cycle and proliferation. RUNX1::RUNX1T1 expression in Mga-deficient murine hematopoietic cells leads to a more aggressive AML with a significantly shortened latency. These data show that MGA regulates multiple pro-proliferative pathways in hematopoietic cells and cooperates with the RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion oncoprotein to enhance leukemogenesis.},

 abstract = {As discovery of cellular diversity in the brain accelerates, so does the need for tools that target cells based on multiple features. Here we developed Conditional Viral Expression by Ribozyme Guided Degradation (ConVERGD), an adeno-associated virus-based, single-construct, intersectional targeting strategy that combines a self-cleaving ribozyme with traditional FLEx switches to deliver molecular cargo to specific neuronal subtypes. ConVERGD offers benefits over existing intersectional expression platforms, such as expanded intersectional targeting with up to five recombinase-based features, accommodation of larger and more complex payloads and a vector that is easy to modify for rapid toolkit expansion. In the present report we employed ConVERGD to characterize an unexplored subpopulation of norepinephrine (NE)-producing neurons within the rodent locus coeruleus that co-express the endogenous opioid gene prodynorphin (Pdyn). These studies showcase ConVERGD as a versatile tool for targeting diverse cell types and reveal Pdyn-expressing NE+ locus coeruleus neurons as a small neuronal subpopulation capable of driving anxiogenic behavioral responses in rodents.},

 abstract = {53BP1 is a well-established DNA damage repair factor that has recently emerged to critically regulate gene expression for tumor suppression and neural development. However, its precise function and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we showed that phosphorylation of 53BP1 at serine 25 by ATM is required for neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in cortical brain organoids. Dynamic phosphorylation of 53BP1-serine 25 controls 53BP1 target genes governing neuronal differentiation and function, cellular response to stress, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, ATM and RNF168 govern 53BP1's binding to gene loci to directly affect gene regulation, especially at genes for neuronal differentiation and maturation. 53BP1 serine 25 phosphorylation effectively impedes its binding to bivalent or H3K27me3-occupied promoters, especially at genes regulating H3K4 methylation, neuronal functions, and cell proliferation. Beyond 53BP1, ATM-dependent phosphorylation displays wide-ranging effects, regulating factors in neuronal differentiation, cytoskeleton, p53 regulation, as well as key signaling pathways such as ATM, BDNF, and WNT during cortical organoid differentiation. Together, our data suggest that the interplay between 53BP1 and ATM orchestrates essential genetic programs for cell morphogenesis, tissue organization, and developmental pathways crucial for human cortical development.},
